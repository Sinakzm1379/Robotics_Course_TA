Course Code Sharing for Robotics Mini Project #1

This GitHub repository contains resources for Mini Project #1 from the Spring 2024 Robotics course and Mechatronics course at the University of Tehran. I am the teaching assistant for this project, which focuses on building a motion sensor-controlled maze game using an Arduino and MPU-6050 accelerometer/gyroscope.
